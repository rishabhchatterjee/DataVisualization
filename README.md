# DataVisualization

Numbers are beautiful. However, their beuaty is hidden in their 'raw' form. When we 
see them as simple digits, we cannot understand their potential - what they can represent. 

This program helps us do two things, first visualize the numbers, and second see 
the beauty of numbers. It uses modular arithmetic (if mode is selected) and recursive
division and drawing to make a network representing how functions, rational, and 
irrational numbers behave with time. 

Using the drawing algorithm, three types of  networks are made - one is a line 
gradient, second is a circular network, and third is a scatterplot - all on the 
same page, simultaneously. Along with this, it makes a sound whenever a solution
or zero is encountered (as depending on the mode) and prints out the solution
or the index value of the zero.

# Modules

Modules I will be using are :
1) Turtle
2) PyAudio
3) Tkinter

How to Download :
1) Turtle
    - Comes installed with Python
2) PyAudio
    - Open Terminal
    - run the following commands    pip3 install pyaudio                (Mac)
                                    python -m pip install pyaudio       (Windows)
3) Tkinter
    - Comes installed with python

    NOTE : use python3 (3.5x)

# Competitive Analysis

While there are no direct competitors to my idea, there are websites and other programs which helps you draw graphs given a data set. These include Microsoft Excel, Dyagraphs, Tableau, etc. However, these softwares are not like mine in the sense that they are not built with the intention to visualize mathematical concepts the way I am doing it by integrating sound into it. Along with that, another difference is that the motivation to build the visualization machine in their cases is simply to allow the user to draw graphs etc but mine is to help teach, and moreover help like, numbers and data, with an additional feature for the visually impaired.
